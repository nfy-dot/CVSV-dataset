0.4 ---> 1.9: He has been trapped in the Arctic alone
1.9 ---> 3.3: It's been almost 3 months
3.3 ---> 5.6: He has survived this long thanks to his good fishing skills
5.8 ---> 7.3: He dug three fishing spots on the ice
7.5 ---> 9.4: He can automatically catch a fish every other day
9.4 ---> 11.1: In the short term, things are still optimistic
11.3 ---> 13.6: But he has no fire, so he can only eat raw fish every day
13.6 ---> 15.4: And there is no summer in this freezing weather
15.6 ---> 17.3: He has already lost two toes to frostbite
17.3 ---> 18.4: If he continues like this
18.4 ---> 19.8: It's only a matter of time before he dies
20.0 ---> 21.1: He is an aircraft mechanic
21.1 ---> 22.7: He had an accident during a flight in the Arctic
22.9 ---> 24.0: He narrowly escaped death
24.0 ---> 26.5: But the plane cannot fly anymore, so he can only be trapped here
26.5 ---> 27.9: He never gave up hope of survival
27.9 ---> 29.2: He dug a huge SOS signal in the snow
29.4 ---> 31.5: hoping that passing planes could see it
31.5 ---> 33.2: He carries a signal transmitter every day
33.2 ---> 35.0: He climbs to a nearby hill and shakes the generator
35.0 ---> 37.1: Sending out his weak signal to the outside world
37.3 ---> 39.2: He shakes it for several hours
39.2 ---> 40.7: The nights in the Arctic are very short now
40.9 ---> 42.5: So he relies on an alarm clock to remind him of the time
42.5 ---> 44.4: Until one day when he woke up, not only did he fail to catch any fish
44.6 ---> 46.3: His fish storage box was torn to pieces
46.3 ---> 47.5: The fish were also eaten up
47.5 ---> 49.8: When he looked down, there was a huge bear paw print
49.8 ---> 51.9: He was frightened and quickly ran back to the cabin
51.9 ---> 53.2: In front of a polar bear
53.4 ---> 55.3: He was nothing more than a big fish
55.5 ---> 58.0: Several hours later, he had to go out again to seek help
58.0 ---> 59.4: But he had to be constantly alert
59.4 ---> 60.5: Stay vigilant
60.5 ---> 63.0: After work that day, he finally saw it in the snow
63.2 ---> 65.7: A white figure almost hidden in the snow
65.9 ---> 67.6: That guy stopped and looked at the man
67.8 ---> 70.1: Seems to be saying that this place is not suitable for long stays
70.3 ---> 71.9: The next day, the man switched to an iron box to store the fish
72.2 ---> 73.4: Hoping it wouldn't be bitten by a bear
73.4 ---> 74.7: A turning point also happened that day
74.9 ---> 77.0: He shook for several hours, and the wind and snow were particularly strong that day
77.0 ---> 79.7: He was about to leave when the signal transmitter suddenly flashed a green light
79.7 ---> 80.9: There are people nearby
81.1 ---> 82.4: He immediately shook the generator desperately
82.6 ---> 86.1: The green light kept flashing, and then a rescue helicopter flew from a distance
86.1 ---> 87.4: Hope has finally arrived
87.4 ---> 88.6: The man lit a signal smoke
88.6 ---> 90.5: Waving it vigorously, the helicopter flew closer and closer
90.7 ---> 91.8: They also spotted him
92.0 ---> 94.3: However, the wind and snow were too strong, and the helicopter couldn't land
94.3 ---> 95.9: Not only that, it was blown away by the wind
96.1 ---> 97.8: And then it crashed out of control
99.1 ---> 102.0: The man almost went crazy, the cruelest thing in the world
102.0 ---> 104.0: Is to give hope and then take it away
104.0 ---> 106.0: He calmed down for a while and ran towards the crash site
106.0 ---> 108.0: He pried open the helicopter door and found two people inside
108.0 ---> 110.0: The male pilot was already dead
110.0 ---> 112.0: There was a woman in the back seat, she was not dead
112.0 ---> 115.0: But she was seriously injured, with a terrifying wound on her stomach
115.0 ---> 117.0: The man found a first aid kit and urgently sutured her wound on the spot
117.0 ---> 120.0: She didn't react at all, he had to continue treating her
120.0 ---> 123.0: But looking at the raging blizzard outside, he could only stay in the helicopter overnight
123.0 ---> 126.0: When daylight came, the man started searching for usable supplies
126.0 ---> 129.0: An ice pick, a map, and instant noodles
